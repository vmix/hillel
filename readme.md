## Homework 01 ##


First **two methods** are described in app.js and module01.js, module02.js files. To run tasks we can use the following statements:

> npm run start

or

> npm start

**Third (experimental) method** is described in experimental file format .mjs and to run one we can use the latest version of node.js. We control several versions of node.js with 'n' manager.

> sudo n latest

, for example.

Next
> node --experimental-modules app03.mjs

or

> npm run start3

In console we will see the following:

_`This is hello3 from Module03`_

_`This area is: 9 sq. meters`_

**Third method** is described in module04.js.
